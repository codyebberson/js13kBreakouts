## Building for js13k with LittleJS...

There is a build file included which uses most engine features and builds the default example into around a 7kb zip. This includes all the overhead of the engine leaving plenty of space for your game. You can use the buildSetup.bat file to install build dependencies with npm and run build.bat to build the package.

The build system works by combining all the js files together, then running several minifiers on the code and zipping the result. You may want to modify the build script to include additional files for your project. These minifiers like Closure and Terser are very good at simplifying code and removing unused code.

It is possible to save even more space by converting the png to a data uri and using that as the image source in the code rather then including a separate file.
